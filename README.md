# Cross Logic

An interactive logic-grid playground inspired by classic Cross Logic / Grid Logic deduction puzzles. The experience keeps the puzzle grid visible at the top of the page while the clue list scrolls independently at the bottom.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit the printed URL (default http://localhost:5173) to interact with the puzzle. Click each grid cell to cycle through a checkmark, an X, or a blank state. Use the **Clear grid** button whenever you want to reset your deductions.

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Then preview the optimized bundle with `npm run preview`.
